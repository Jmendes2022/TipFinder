# React + Vite

Small project using React Vite and ChakraUI to find the tip percentage of a bill. User history is persisted in local storage and displayed within a table,
displaying the total amount of tips that they have paid in their history, their average Tipping percentage, and their average bill cost.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
